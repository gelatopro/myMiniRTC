For this task, you’ll build **MiniRTC** — a simple one‑to‑one (1:1) calling product.

**Core user flow**

* User creates or joins a room by URL.  
* Two users in the same room can start a call (audio required, video optional).  
* Show basic call UI:  
  * Join/Leave  
  * Mute/Unmute  
  * Connection Status  
  * Handle Common Errors

**Backend**

* Any transport that makes sense \- we’d love to hear why that transport  
* Room membership tracking, presence events.  
* Minimal security: room IDs should be non-guessable or validated.

**Scalability / cost**

* Write a short section in [DECISIONS.md](http://DECISIONS.md):  
* What breaks if you had 10k rooms/day?  
* How you’d keep costs sane  
* What you’d do about NAT traversal (TURN) in “real life”  
* Deploy somewhere (optional but valued)

**Deliverables**

* Repo link (or zip)  
* [README.md](http://README.md) (run locally, what you built, what you skipped)  
* [DECISIONS.md](http://DECISIONS.md) (tradeoffs, scaling/cost, explain what the different technologies at play actually do)  
* Optional: deployed link and/or short demo
